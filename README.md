# APLTesting

This Django application serves you tiny programming problems based on templates.
You should be able to build the docker image and run the server as usual.
Then go to https://server/entry/welcome and choose one of the tests to take them.

Currently there's no user or score management built-in, because the application seems to be best used as practice and not as formal assessment.

## Which tests are available

The database is seeded with four tests that comprise several types of questions. The questions are also provided in the database. To seed manually, use:

    python3 manage.py loaddata tests
    python3 manage.py loaddata questions

## Dependencies

As seen in the Pipfile this application depends on the unreleased interpreter for the "Basis" language.
